    <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
    <p>Pointless to describe, as most people can conjure up an instant image.  This wrought iron tower has been the indisputable symbol of Paris 
        since it opened in 1889 as the entrance to the World’s Fair.</p>
        <p>f you’re keen to stay on the well beaten tourists track, you can’t get more beaten than this.  The Eiffel Tower is the most visited
             monument in the world that you have to pay to see.</p>

       <h3>Arc de Triomphe</h3>
       <p>Ah, the world’s most beautiful avenue. The tree-lined Avenue des Champs-Élysées (Parisians know it as “les Champs”) is a famous 
        gathering place for national celebrations and holiday festivities as well as the home of iconic French fashion brands like Longchamp 
        and the Louis Vuitton flagship. Les Champs is most known for shopping, especially to tourists, but there’s so much more to do here.</p>
