    <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
    <p>Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and certainly one of Indiaâ€™s most famous landmarks, 
        the Taj Mahal is a living testament to the grandiose and the romantic. Built from white marble by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 
        memory of his favorite wife, the structure is decorated with carvings of flowers and inlays of semi-precious stones</p>

       <h3>Gateway of India</h3>
       <p>One of Mumbai's most recognizable attractions, the triple-arched Gateway of India was built during the early 20th century in honor of 
        the 1911 visit of King George V. Built of basalt and concrete, this monument was designed in the Indo-Saracenic style, which blends 
        traditional Indian, Victorian, and Mughal architectural elements.</p>
